    <h1>GAME OF PIG</h1>
    <p>
      There are two players. Each takes turn rolling the dice. Points are accumulated during a players turn, and can be
      offered to THE PIG, ending the turn. Rolling double 1's will awaken THE PIG's wrath and your ALL offerings will be
      destroyed. Rolling a single 1 will forfeit the player's offerings this turn and the next player will begin their
      tribute. The first player to provide THE PIG 100 offerings will descend into blissful, unending filth.
